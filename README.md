# Lane-Segmentation-Using-CNN

Lane detection on the road is a critical component in the development of expert driver assistance systems and self-driving cars. 
Deep learning approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in road lane recognition in recent years, owing to their capacity to learn complicated features and patterns from photos. 
A study on road lane recognition using deep learning algorithms is presented in this project. 
In this project we identified the lane marks on the road by masking the images. 
For this project we used CNN and plotted the values for overall validation loss using 3 different optimizers â€“ RMSprop , Adam and Nadam. 
RMSprop had the lowest validation loss as when compared to that of Adam and Nadam. But the validation loss increases in case of RMSprop instead of decreasing when compared to Adam and Nadam. 
In the project the loss value was much higher but when the model was tuned the validation loss dropped significantly expect for RMSprop.
